2. The Zennet Application 

The 'Zennet' application currently being developed by Company combines a peer-to-peer 

networking platform with a blockchain based architecture to deliver a platform for trading in 

decentralized and distributed high performance computational resources ("Zennet 

Application" and "Computational Resources", respectively). The Zennet Application is 

intended to create a platform through which individuals and entities can rent computational 

resources from other individuals and entities wishing to sell their excessive computational 

resources, in consideration for payment in the Zennet Application’s cryptography-secured 

token, Zencoin. The launch of the Zennet Application is currently scheduled for the third 

calendar quarter of year 2015. [Zennet - [Please review carefully and confirm]

WHILE COMPANY IS MAKING COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO SUCCESSFULLY 

COMPLETE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ZENNET APPLICATION, COMPANY CANNOT AND 

DOES NOT MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES CONCERNING THE ZENNET 

APPLICATION INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THAT THE ZENNET APPLICATION WILL BE 

SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED AND FULLY OPERATIONAL OR THAT IT WILL BE LAUNCHED AT 

THE TIME SPECIFIED ABOVE, AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW 

COMPANY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND REGARDING THE ZENNET 

APPLICATION, WHETHER STATUTORY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT 

NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY OR FITNESS FOR A 

PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

3. Zencoins

a) What are Zencoins

The Zencoins are intended to be in-application cryptographic tokens, designed to be usable 

on the Zennet Application, if and when successfully developed and fully operational. 

Individuals and entities wishing to purchase Computational Resources from other individuals 

and entities via the Zennet Application, will pay for such Computational Resources in 

Zencoins. Important: Currently the Zennet Application is still under development and 

therefore at the time of this Pre-Sale and until when and if the Zennet Application is 

successfully developed and becomes fully operational, there will be no use for Zencoins.

Concurrently with the launch of a fully operational version of the Zennet Application (when 

and if successfully developed), Company will create a fixed number of Zencoins, in an 

amount determined as described below (the "Total Number of Zencoins"). After that, no 

additional Zencoins will be created.

b) The Zencoins Allocation

The Zencoins to be sold at the Pre-Sale will constitute 10% (ten percent) of the Total Number 

of Zencoins. The remaining 90% (ninety percent) of the Total Quantity of Zencoins, will be 

allocated as follows: (i) 70% (seventy percent) of the Total Quantity of Zencoins will be 

distributed to purchasers of Zencoins at Subsequent Sales (as defined below); (ii) 8% (eight 

percent) of the Total Quantity of Zencoins will be retained by Company for community 

applications [??], third party developers, and bounties during the early stages of the Zennet 

Application, (iii) 4% (four percent) of the Total Quantity of Zencoins will be retained for 

supporting initial network growth by creating resource demand and incentivize the joining of 

new nodes during the Zennet Application’s early stages; and (iv) 8% (eight percent) of the 

Total Quantity of Zencoins will be retained by the Zennet Team. 

During the period subsequent to the conclusion of the Pre-Sale and prior to the launch of 

the Zennet Application, Company intends to sell additional Zencoins ("Subsequent Sales"), 

to the public and to potential Consumers of Computational Resources, such as but not 

limited to corporations, academia, research centers, etc. Company undertakes that the 

purchase price of Zencoins at these Subsequent Sales will be not less than the Pre-Sale Price 

per Zencoin (the price established for the Zencoins at the Pre-Sale).

Company reserves sole discretion to determine the rate at which Zencoins will be distributed 

to Purchasers and to any other persons entitled thereto under any of the categories 

described in subsections (i) – (iv) above, provided, however, that the rate of distribution will 

be applied equally to each category, so that on each distribution instance, the persons 

entitled to receive Zencoins under each such category will receive an identical portion of the 

total amount of Zencoins allocated to the respective category. For example: If on the first 

day of the Zennet Application launch, Company will elect to distribute to the Purchasers only 

20% of the Pre-Sale Zencoins (i.e. 2% of the Total Number of Zencoins), then until it 

distributes additional Pre-Sale Zencoins to the Purchasers, it will not distribute more than 

14% of the Total Number of Zencoins to purchasers in the Subsequent Sales (i.e. under 

category (ii) above), and it will not distribute more than 4% of the Total Number of Zencoins, 

in the aggregate, to the persons entitled to receive Zencoins pursuant to the categories 

described in subsections (iii) and (iv) above.[Zennet – please confirm]

In addition, Company reserves sole discretion to determine the identity of the persons that 

will receive Zencoins pursuant to the categories described in subsections (iii) and (iv) above, 

and the quantity of Zencoins to be distributed to each such person. 

c) The quantity of Zencoins to be created

The Total Quantity of Zencoins to be created by Company as described above will be 

determined (immediately prior to the launch of the Zennet Application, as described above), 

according to the following formula: 

Whereby: 

X = the aggregate number of Zencoins purchased at the Subsequent Sales (as 

defined below); and

Y = Total Quantity of Zencoins.

4. The Pre-Sale

a) The quantity of Zencoins to be sold at the Pre-Sale and the purchase price

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms, Company is offering to sell 

to Purchasers Zencoins constituting 10% (ten percent) of the Total Quantity of Zencoins 

("Pre-Sale Zencoins"), in consideration for payment by the Purchasers of the Pre-Sale 

Price per Zencoin (as defined below) for each Zencoin purchased. Initially Company 

estimates that the quantity of Pre-Sale Zencoins will be [*] (the "Estimated Quantity of 

Pre-Sale Zencoins"), however Company will only be able to determine the final quantity 

of Pre-Sale Zencoins after conclusion of the Subsequent Sales (the "Final Quantity of 

Pre-Sale Zencoins").

During the Pre-Sale Period, no price will be established for the Pre-Sale Zencoins. The 

initial price of the Pre-Sale Zencoins ("Initial Pre-Sale Price per Zencoin") will be 

established after conclusion of the Pre-Sale, and will be determined by dividing (A) the 

total US$-equivalent amount of Bitcoins paid by all Purchasers participating at the Pre-

Sale, by (B) the Estimated Quantity of Pre-Sale Zencoins. The final price of for the Pre-

Sale Zencoins ("Final Pre-Sale Price per Zencoin") will be established after conclusion of 

the Subsequent Sales and the subsequent determination of the Final Quantity of Pre-

Sale Zencoins, and will be determined by dividing (A) the total The US$-Equivalent 

Amount of Bitcoins paid by all Purchasers participating at the Pre-Sale, by (B) the Final 

Quantity of Pre-Sale Zencoins. The "US$-Equivalent Amount of Bitcoins" paid by each 

Purchaser will be determined according to the average Bitcoins/USD exchange rate 

during the Pre-Sale Period, as published by [*] at [*]. 

b) How many Zencoins will each Purchaser Receive

Each Purchaser participating in the Pre-Sale will receive the quantity of Zencoins (and/or 

fractions thereof, if necessary) determined by the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the 

US$-Equivalent Amount of Bitcoins paid by such Purchaser (the "Purchase Amount"), by 

(B) the Final Pre-Sale Price per Zencoin. 

c) The Pre-Sale Period

The Pre-Sale will begin with a 10-day private Pre-Sale to select value-added partners in 

the Bitcoin sector. The public Pre-Sale will then begin on December. 1, 9:00AM PST and 

run for 36 days through Jan. 5, 2015 (the "Pre-Sale Period").  The sale will close at 

January 5th 23:59:59 PST latest, [or when the 3,000 Bitcoins cap / YYY Zencoins cap is 

hit, whichever happens first].[Zennet – please amend]

Company reserves the right to change the starting date of the Pre-Sale and extend the 

duration of the Pre-Sale Period for any reason, including without limitation the 

unavailability of the Zennet website at http://zennet.sc or other unforeseen issues. 

Though it does not currently anticipate doing so, Company reserves the right to shorten 

the duration of the Pre-Sale Period for any reason.

d) Where do I send the purchase price 

Each Purchaser is required to transmit such Purchaser's respective 

Purchase Amount (for the Pre-Sale Zencoins purchased by such Purchaser) 

in Bitcoins, to the Pre-Sale address provided by Company on the Pre-Sale 

page of the Zennet website at http://zennet.sc (the "Pre-Sale Bitcoin 

Address"). Each Purchaser may transmit its Purchase Amount in one or 

more installments, provided they are all received at the Pre-Sale Bitcoin 

Address within the Pre-Sale Period.

Caution: No other website shall be authorized to provide a Pre-Sale Bitcoin Address to 

collect or accept any payment under the Pre-Sale. Beware of attempted spoofing or 

phishing attempts which may occur during the Pre-Sale Period. 

Important: Each Purchaser is required to transmit such Purchaser's 

respective Purchase Amount from an address such as Bitcoin Core or 

Bitcoin-QT wallet, or from Blockchain.info. Future address verification will 

be required for the distribution of Zencoins, and this will be done via the 

Sign Message mechanism, with a possible fallback option to other methods 

of verification. [Please explain this]

Failure to observe fully the instructions provided in these Terms and on the Pre-Sale 

page of the Zennet website at http://zennet.sc, may delay or prevent acceptance of 

Purchaser’s purchase request and Purchaser’s receipt of Zencoins.

e) Limitations on the Purchase of Zencoins 

In the interest of encouraging broad global participation in the Pre-Sale, Company 

hereby prohibits any single entity, person or group of entities (i.e. multiple entities with 

the same owner, or multiple entities in which one owns one or more of the others, or 

multiple entities who have entered into a joint venture) from purchasing more than 10% 

of the Pre-Sale Zencoins. 

Any entity, person or group of associated entities (as described above) wishing to 

purchase more than 10% of the Estimated Quantity of Pre-Sale Zencoins must first 

contact Company directly at [                       ] to clear the purchase.

By participating in the Pre-Sale, each Purchaser agrees that, to the best of Purchaser’s 

knowledge after making all necessary inquiries, Purchaser’s participation in the Pre-Sale 

will not cause any entity, person, corporation, or group of associated entities to 

purchase more than 10% of the Estimated Quantity of Pre-Sale Zencoins.  

f) Disclosure of Purchases 

Company undertakes to make all purchases of Zencoins at the Pre-Sale publicly visible 

and verifiable on the Bitcoin blockchain at the Zencoins' genesis address. [Zennet - 

please confirm + is the highlighted part clear?]

g) WARNING: ALL PURCHASES OF ZENCOINS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE

ALL PURCHASES OF ZENCOINS ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. BY PURCHASING 

ZENCOINS, PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NONE OF THE ZENNET PARTIES ARE 

REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON, AND THAT PURCHASER WILL NOT 

RECEIVE MONEY OR OTHER COMPENSATION FOR ANY ZENCOINS THAT ARE UNUSABLE OR 

NONTRANSFERABLE FOR ANY REASON.

h) WARNING: CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS OF VALUE MAY EXPERIENCE EXTREME 

VOLATILITY IN PRICING

Cryptographic currencies that possess value in public markets, have regularly demonstrated 

extreme fluctuations in price over short periods of time. A Purchaser of Zencoins should be 

prepared to expect similar fluctuations, both up and down, in the price of Zencoins 

denominated in Bitcoins or United States dollars (“USD”) or fiat money of other jurisdictions. 

Such fluctuations are due to market forces and represent changes in supply and demand, 

including without limitation supply and demand of Computational Resources via the Zennet 

Application, if and when it becomes operational. 

Company cannot and does not guarantee market liquidity for Zencoins, and Zencoins may be 

difficult or impossible to buy or sell temporarily or permanently. Also, the volatility and 

unpredictability of the price of virtual tokens relative to fiat currency may result in significant 

loss or tax liability over a short period of time. Additionally, due to different regulatory 

dictates in different jurisdictions and the inability of citizens of certain jurisdictions to open 

accounts at exchanges located anywhere in the world, the liquidity of Zencoins may be 

markedly different in different countries. This is likely to manifest in price discrepancies 

between sources of Zencoins.

By purchasing Zencoins, you expressly acknowledge and represent that you fully understand 

that Zencoins, if traded, may experience price volatility, and that you will not seek to hold 

Company or any of the Zennet Parties liable for any losses or any direct, indirect, special, 

incidental, or consequential damages arising from, or in any way connected to the purchase 

or sale of Zencoins.

i) WARNING: DO NOT PURCHASE ZENCOINS IF YOU ARE NOT AN EXPERT IN DEALING 

WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC TOKENS AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED SOFTWARE SYSTEMS 

The Zennet Team will provide general guidelines regarding user usage and storage of 

Zencoins before the Zennet Application becomes operational. However, Purchases of 

Zencoins should be undertaken only by individuals or entities with significant experience 

with and understanding of the usage and intricacies of cryptographic tokens, and blockchain-

based software systems, including without limitation deep understanding of and experience 

with storage and transmission mechanisms for cryptographic tokens. Company and other 

members of the Zennet Team will not be responsible for any loss of Zencoins resulting from 

any action or inaction by a Purchaser. Purchasers must ensure they are using a secure 

computing environment and must ensure that they obtain a sending address' private key 

and not lose it, so as to be sure that they will be able to access their Zencoins once they are 

transferred to their control at such sending address. [Zennet – please confirm]

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH UNDERSTANDING AND EXPERIENCE, THEN YOU SHOULD NOT 

PURCHASE ZENCOINS NOR PARTICIPATE IN THE PRE-SALE.

j) Taxation of Zencoins and Taxation Related to the Pre-Sale

Company makes no representations concerning the tax implications of the purchase or sale 

of Zencoins or the possession or use of Zencoins. Purchaser bears sole and exclusive 

responsibility for determining if the purchase or sale of Zencoins, the possession or use of 

Zencoins, or the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of Zencoins over time, 

has tax implications for Purchaser, including in Purchaser’s home jurisdiction. By purchasing 

Zencoins, and to the extent permitted by law, Purchaser agrees not hold any of the Zennet 

Parties liable for any tax liability associated with or arising from the purchase, sale, use or 

possession of Zencoins or the potential appreciation or depreciation in the value of Zencoins 

over time.

k) Pre-Sale Not An Investment 

THE PRE-SALE AND THESE TERMS ARE NOT SOLICITATIONS FOR INVESTMENT AND DO NOT 

PERTAIN IN ANY WAY TO AN OFFERING OF SECURITIES IN ANY JURISDICTION. ZENCOINS ARE 

AN IN-APPLICATION TOKEN THAT IS INTENDED TO BE USEABLE SOLELY AS A CREDIT FOR 

PURCHASING COMPUTING RESOURCES VIA THE ZENNET APPLICATION, IF AND WHEN 

SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED AND FULLY OPERATIONAL. ZENCOINS ARE NOT A SECURITY, A 

CURRENCY OR AN INVESTMENT OFFERING, THEY DO NOT PROVIDE VOTING RIGHTS, 

SHARES, OR AN INTEREST IN PROFITS OR REVENUE, AND THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES OF 

THEIR FUTURE USE OR VALUE. IN ADDITION THERE IS NO PLAN TO MAKE ZENCOINS INTO A 

GENERAL-PURPOSE TOKEN OR CURRENCY. THIS PRE-SALE IS VOID IN ANY JURISDICTION 

WHERE THE PRE-SALE OR ZENCOINS ARE REQUIRED TO BE REGISTERED AS SECURITIES OR 

INVESTMENT UNDER APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION.

Purchasers may be interested in purchasing Zencoins in the Pre-sale in order to support the 

development of the Zennet Application, or with the future intention of purchasing 

Computational Resources via the Zennet Application. Individuals, businesses, and other 

organizations should carefully weigh the risks, costs, and benefits of acquiring Zencoins early 

in the Pre-Sale versus waiting to purchase Zencoins on open, third-party exchanges or in in-

house exchanges once the Zennet Application is fully operational and when they or their 

businesses actually wish to use the Zencoins.

l) Important Notices

● At the time of the Pre-Sale, the Zennet Application is still in the development stage, 

has not been launched, and is not operational. Until such time, if any, no Zencoins 

will be created or distributed, Zencoins are not functional in any way, and cannot be 

exchanged.

● Company reserves the right to accept or decline any Purchaser's request to purchase 

Zencoins; such decision by Company shall be within its sole discretion and deemed 

to have occurred at the designated location of Company rather than the location of 

the Purchaser.

● Ownership of Zencoins carries no express or implied rights. Zencoins will not provide 

Purchasers with any control or influence over the development or governance of the 

Zennet Application or BITCOINS the Company. 

● Purchases of Zencoins are non-refundable.

● Minors Prohibited: The Pre-Sale is not directed to individuals under the age of 

eighteen (18).  If you are under the age of eighteen, you are not authorized to 

purchase Zencoins in the Pre-Sale unless you have received permission to do so from 

your legal guardian who has reviewed and agreed to these Terms and all other 

instructions relating to the Pre-Sale.

● Company reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Pre-Sale and/or 

the access to any content and information placed by Company on the Platform, or 

any part thereof, at any time and without notice to you, and Company will not be 

liable to you should it exercise such rights.

● Company reserves the right at all times to disclose any information relating to 

Purchaser as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation or government request, or to 

refuse to sell Zencoins to Purchaser if Company believes that Purchaser does not 

comply with the requirements from a Purchaser under these Terms or is in breach of 

these Terms or applicable law, or for any other reason, all without notice or liability. 

m) Obligation To Determine If Purchaser Can Purchase, Possess or Use Zencoins in 

Purchaser’s Jurisdiction [Note: to be finally confirmed with U.S. lawyers]

This Pre-Sale is conducted by Company, an Israeli company operating under the laws of the 

State of Israel and constitutes the sale of Computational Resources under such laws[Please 

confirm presentation with accountants]. The Pre-Sale conducted on the Platform is 

accessible world-wide; however we make no representation that the Pre-Sale and Zencoins 

are appropriate or authorized for use in all jurisdictions.  Your purchase, possession or use of 

Zencoins may not be legal in your jurisdiction. If you choose to purchase Zencoins at the Pre-

Sale, you do so on your own initiative and risk, and you are responsible for compliance with 

all applicable laws. We reserve the right to limit, in our sole discretion, the sale of any 

Zencoins at the Pre-Sale to any person and geographic area.

5.  Certain Risks Associated with the Purchase of Zencoins

The purchase of Zencoins carries with it a number of risks. Prior to purchasing Zencoins, 

Purchaser should carefully consider the risks set out below, and to the extent necessary, 

consult with a lawyer, accountant and/or tax professional experienced in cryptographic 

tokens prior to determining whether to purchase Zencoins. If any of the following risks are 

unacceptable to you, you should not purchase Zencoins or participate in the Pre-Sale of 

Zencoins. By purchasing Zencoins, and to the extent permitted by law, you are expressly 

agreeing not to hold any of the Zennet Parties liable for any losses or any direct, indirect, 

special, incidental, or consequential damages in any way connected with the Pre-Sale or the 

purchase, sale, possession or use of Zencoins, including without limitation in connection 

with any of the risks set forth below. 

a) Risk of Dissolution of the Zennet Project Due To a Diminishment in the Value of 

Bitcoins Sale Revenue 

Completion of the development of the Zennet Application largely depends on the 

Bitcoins proceeds derived from the Pre-Sale. Since all Purchasers are paying Bitcoins 

to purchase Zencoins, it is possible that a drop in the value of Bitcoins could leave 

Company with insufficient resources to operate.  In order to guard against this risk, 

from time to time Company intends to convert Bitcoins Proceeds from the Pre-Sale 

into fiat currencies. 

b) Transactions in Cryptotokens are Generally Irreversible 

The Zencoins are cryptographic tokens representing credits for Computational 

Resources via the Company's Zennet Application. Like transactions in 

cryptocurrencies, transactions in cryptotokens are generally irreversible, and, 

accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be 

recoverable. Also, the nature of cryptographic tokens may lead to an increased risk 

of fraud or cyber-attack.

c) Risk Of Spoofing Or Phishing Attempts

Purchaser should be aware of spoofing or phishing attempts. Purchaser should not 

respond to any inquiries regarding their purchase of Zencoins, including without 

limitation to email requests seemingly from Company or the zennet.sc or similar 

looking domain.

d) Risk of Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions 

Virtual currencies are undergoing regulatory scrutiny by various regulatory bodies in 

multiple jurisdictions, and their regulation in certain aspects is currently unclear and 

evolving, therefore one or more legislative or regulatory changes, inquiries or 

actions might impede or limit the ability to continue to develop or operate the 

Zennet Application, or adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of the 

Zencoins. Company believes that Zencoins are cryptographic tokens representing 

credits for Computational Resources on the Zennet Application and not a virtual 

currency, nevertheless, the laws and regulation applicable to cryptocurrencies are 

currently unclear and evolving and therefore at some time Zencoins may be 

classified as a virtual currency and hence affected by regulation of virtual currencies.

e) Virtual Currencies and Virtual Tokens Are Not Legal Tender

Virtual currencies and virtual tokens are not legal tender, are not government-

backed, and Zencoins, accounts, value balances and Purchaser Wallets are not 

subject, inter alia, to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor 

Protection Corporation protections. 

f) Risk of Alternative Distributed Instant Messaging Software Application

It is possible that alternative distributed instant messaging mobile software 

applications could be established that may or may not utilize the same open source 

code and open source protocol underlying the Zennet Application. The Zennet 

Application may compete with these alternative distributed instant messaging 

software applications, and this could negatively impact the development of the 

Zennet Application and/or the success and viability of the Zennet Application, 

resulting in little or no market for Zencoins. 

g) Risk of Insufficient Interest In The Zennet Application Or Distributed 

Computational Resources Software Applications And/Or Reluctance Of Users To Consent 

To Receiving Computational Resources

It is possible that there will be limited public interest in the creation or use of the 

Zennet Application, including without limitation if potential Users will be reluctant to 

receive Computational Resources via the Zennet Application. Such a lack of use or 

interest, or reluctance to purchase Computational Resources, could negatively 

impact the development of the Zennet Application and/or the success and viability 

of the Zennet Application, resulting in little or no market for Zencoins. Company is 

working with third-parties around the world to create an interest in the Zennet 

Application. However, Company cannot predict the success of its own development 

efforts or the efforts of other third parties.

h) Risk that the Zennet Application, as Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of 

Purchaser

Purchaser recognizes that the Zennet Application is presently under development 

and may undergo significant changes before release. Purchaser acknowledges that 

Purchaser’s expectations regarding the form and functionality of the Zennet 

Application and the use of the Zencoins thereon, may not be met upon the 

operation of the Zennet Application, for any number of reasons including without 

limitation a change in design or implementation plans, and execution of the 

implementation of the Zennet Application. Purchaser also recognizes that Company 

intends that the Zennet Application will be launched and initially operated without 

the Computational Resources feature, meaning that Zencoins will not be usable on 

at least the initial version of Zennet Application.

i) Risk that the Zennet Application May Never be Completed or Released or May be 

Released Later Than Planned 

Purchaser understands that while the Zennet Team is making good faith efforts to 

complete the development of the Zennet Application, it is possible that the 

development of the Zennet Application may not be successfully completed or be 

completed or launched later than planned. 

j) Risk of Theft of Proceeds 

Hackers or other groups or organizations may attempt to steal Company's Zencoins 

or th eBitcoin proceeds from the Pre-Sale, thus potentially impacting the ability of 

Company to develop and operate the Zennet Application. To account for this risk, 

Company has and will continue to implement comprehensive security precautions to 

safeguard the Zencoins and the proceeds obtained from the Pre-Sale.

k) Risk of Security Weaknesses in the Zennet Application Software

The Zennet Application is built on open-source software and is vulnerable to actions 

involving this underlying software, including without limitation the risk that the 

Zennet Team or third parties unassociated with the Zennet Team may introduce 

weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the Zennet Application. 

This could, among other things, cause the system to lose Zencoins stored in one or 

more Purchaser accounts or other accounts or lose sums of other valued tokens 

issued on the Zennet Application, or cause the Zennet Application to fail to operate 

as anticipated, causing a lack of interest in or failure of the Zennet Application which 

in turn could lead to a lack of potential use of, and interest in, the Zencoins. 

Company has taken steps to build, maintain, and secure the infrastructure of the 

Zennet Application, and will continue to do so after the Pre-Sale. For example, 

Company intends to hire external consultants on a periodic basis to assess and audit 

the security of the Zennet Application and will work with cryptography and security 

experts to develop and employ best practices to audit the Zennet Application.

l) Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography

Advances in code cracking algorithms or techniques or technical progress in the 

form of quantum computers could present risks to cryptocurrencies and 

cryptography-secured tokens including without limitation the Zennet Application, 

which could result in the theft or loss of Zencoins. To the extent possible, Company 

intends to update the protocol underlying the Zennet Application to account for 

advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures, but 

cannot predict the future of cryptography or the success of future security updates 

or the effectiveness of updating the protocol underlying the Zennet Application.

m) Risk of Cryptographic Token Attacks

As with other cryptotokens (and cryptocurrencies), the Bitcoins blockchain used for 

the Zennet Application is susceptible to cryptographic attacks. Any successful attacks 

present a risk to the Zennet Application, expected proper execution and sequencing 

of Zencoins transactions. 

n) Risk of Multispending

Zencoins transactions shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a “block 

chain” ledger. [Zennet – please explain the risk]

o) Risk of a Mismatch between the Supply and Demand for Computational Resources 

via the Zennet Application

It is possible that the supply by Users of Computational Resources via the Zennet 

Application could rise at a pace exceeding the rate with which potential Consumer 

wish to purchase such Computational Resources. Under either scenario, trust and 

interest in the Zennet Application may decrease or cease, resulting in little or no 

market for Zencoins. 

p) Risk of Being Based On Rapidly Evolving Technologies

The Zennet Application and Zencoins are based on dynamic and rapidly evolving 

technologies – semi-decentralized bitcoin blockchain and   distributed computing 

  

resources. Our ability to plan for development and operational activities may be 

significantly affected by our ability to anticipate and adapt to relatively rapid 

changes in these technologies. A failure to keep up with evolving technologies could 

negatively impact any of the development of the Zennet Application and/or the 

success and viability of the Zennet Application, resulting in little or no market for 

Zencoins.

q) Public Opinion In Relation To Use of Cryptographic Tokens

The value of cryptographic tokens is derived from the continued willingness of 

market participants to use cryptographic tokens and to exchange them for fiat 

money, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a 

particular cryptographic token should the market for that cryptographic token 

disappear. 

r) Public Opinion In Relation To The Use of Decentralized Applications and 

Distributed Computational Resources Applications

Negative changes in public opinion, that is, low willingness to new Instant Messaging 

Applications, might reduce the popularity of the Zennet Application, resulting in 

little or no market for Zencoins. 

6. Privacy

Company requires that Purchasers provide an email address as identifying information. 

Except to the extent legally required to provide such information to any regulatory 

authority in any jurisdiction, Company will not publish any identifying information 

related to a Purchaser or a Zencoins purchase, without the prior written consent of the 

applicable Purchaser.

Purchasers expressly agree that they may be contacted by email by Company regarding 

a purchase. Such emails will be informational only. Company will not request any

9. Jurisdiction of the Pre-Sale

Company, the legal entity creating and selling the Zencoins, is organized under the laws 

of the State of Israel. No purchase or sale of Zencoins shall be deemed to have taken 

place until and except upon the acceptance by Company of a Purchaser’s request to 

participate in the Pre-Sale. Company’s acceptance occurs in the jurisdiction to which the 

Proceeds are transferred for the benefit of Company upon the close of the Pre-Sale, and 

shall not be deemed to have occurred prior to that date, nor at whatever jurisdiction 

from which a Purchaser submitted is request to participate in the Pre-Sale. 

10. Governing Law

You agree that the laws of the State of Israel, without regard to the principles of conflicts 

of laws thereof, will govern these Terms and all matters relating to your participation in 

the Pre-Sale, purchase of Zencoins, and use of the Zennet Application, including all 

disputes between you and Company. Subject to the Dispute Resolutions section below, 

you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts of Tel Aviv, 

Israel, in any related action or proceeding.

11. Dispute Resolution 

All disputes, controversies or claims arising out of, relating to, or in connection with 

these Terms, including their efficacy, interpretation or breach, shall be finally settled 

under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce ("ICC"), by 

one arbitrator appointed in accordance with said Rules. All claims between the parties 

relating to these Terms that are capable of being resolved by arbitration, whether 

sounding in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall be submitted to ICC arbitration. Prior to 

commencing arbitration, the parties have a duty to negotiate in good faith and attempt 

to resolve their dispute in a manner other than by submission to ICC arbitration.

The arbitration panel shall consist of one Israeli arbitrator that is independent of the 

parties involved in the arbitration. The place of arbitration shall be Tel Aviv, Israel. The 

language of the arbitration shall be English. In deciding the merits of the dispute, the 

arbitrator shall apply the substantive laws of the State of Israel and any discovery shall 

be limited and shall not involve any depositions or any other examinations outside of a 

formal hearing. In the final award, the tribunal shall fix the costs of the arbitration and 

decide which of the parties shall bear such costs in what proportion. Every award shall 

be binding on the parties. The parties undertake to carry out the award without delay 

and waive their right to any form of recourse against the award in so far as such waiver 

can validly be made.

12. Notices

Company may send you notices by sending an email message to the email address 

provided by you at the Pre-Sale or by a posting on the Zennet Website at 

http://zennet.sc. Notices shall become effective immediately upon their distribution or 

posting. It is your responsibility to check the Zennet Website at http://zennet.sc on a 

regular basis in order to remain updated with Company notices. 

13. Assignment

You agree that we may assign any of our rights, and/or transfer, sub-contract or 

delegate any of our obligations, under these Terms. Your agreement to these Terms is 

personal to you and you may not transfer or assign it to any third party.

14. Force Majeure

Company is not liable for failure to perform caused by force majeure, which shall include 

without limitation the following:

● unavoidable casualty,

● delays in delivery of materials,

● embargoes,

● government orders, regulations or inquiries,

● acts of civil or military authorities,

● acts by common carriers, unforeseen or emergency conditions (including without 

limitation weather conditions) incompatible with safety or good quality 

workmanship, 

● delays of suppliers or developers, or

● any other event that renders performance commercially implausible.

If an event of force majeure occurs, Company may elect to suspend its obligations 

hereunder to the extent affected by the force majeure event. 

15. Complete Agreement

THESE TERMS SET FORTH THE ENTIRE UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN EACH PURCHASER 

AND COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF ZENCOINS DURING THE 

PRE-SALE, AND SUPERSEDE ALL PRIOR OR CONTEMPORANEOUS COMMUNICATIONS 

AND PROPOSALS, WHETHER ELECTRONIC, ORAL OR WRITTEN, BETWEEN PURCHASER 

AND COMPANY, WITH RESPECT TO PURCHASER'S PURCHASE OF ZENCOINS AT THE PRE-

SALE AND ALL MATTERS RELATING TO ZENCOINS.

For facts relating to the sale and purchase, Purchaser agrees to rely only on these Terms 

in determining purchase decisions and understands that this document governs the 

relationship between Company and Purchaser regarding the sale and purchase of 

Zencoins and supersedes any public statements about the sale and purchase of Zencoins 

or the Pre-Sale, made by Company or any of the Zennet Parties prior to and during the 

Pre-Sale.

A printed version of these Terms and of any notice given in electronic form shall be 

admissible in any and all judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to 

these Terms to the same extent as other business documents and records originally 

generated and maintained in printed form.

16. Severability

If any portion of these Terms is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part, such 

provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable 

provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, without 

affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other manner or jurisdiction and 

without affecting the remaining provisions of these Terms, which shall continue to be in 

full force and effect.

17. No Waiver

The failure to require or enforce strict performance by Purchaser of any provision of 

these Terms or failure to exercise any right under these Terms shall not be construed as 

a waiver or relinquishment of the right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right 

in that or any other instance.

The express waiver of any provision, condition, or requirement of these Terms  shall not 

constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or 

requirement.

18. Updates to these Terms and Conditions of the Zencoins Pre-Sale

Company reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove 

portions of these Terms at any time prior to or during the Pre-Sale by posting the 

amended Terms on the Zennet website (http://zennet.sc). Any Purchaser purchasing 

Zencoins after said posting will be deemed to have accepted such changes. If at any 

point Purchaser does not agree to any portion of the then-current version of the Terms, 

Purchaser should not purchase Zencoins.

Subject to the foregoing paragraph, these Terms may not be amended except in writing 

and approved by both Purchaser and Company, or by decision of Company and approval 

of Purchasers' purchasing a simple majority (over 50%) of the Pre-Sale Zencoins, without 

taking into consideration abstaining votes. [Zennet – is this practical? Will you know 

their identities?] 

19. Cooperation with Legal Authorities

Company will cooperate with all law enforcement inquiries, subpoenas, or requests 

provided they are fully supported and documented by the law in the relevant 

jurisdictions. In accordance with the cryptography-inspired value of transparency 

Company will endeavor to publish any legal inquiries upon receipt, to the extent it is 

allowed to do so.
